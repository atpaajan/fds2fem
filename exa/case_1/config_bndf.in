# fds2abqs: Sample configuration file
#------------------------------------
# This uses BNDF wall temperature output of FDS. FDS and ABAQUS 
# geometries are not matching, so translation and/or rotation are
# needed. These are done using the "automatic" option of fds2fem.
# Abaqus model contains just one door and just one face is picked
# there, so the automatic routine should be able to match the doors,
# because a common z-axis is assumed. NOTE: The automatic translation
# might give a rotation that is not unique so the matching could
# be "180 degrees off" for a symmetrical object. If this is the case,
# use the manual mapping instead.
#
# Each FDS patch (bndf surface) is matched to the corresponding
# ABAQUS nset using the connectivity file nset_bndfA.in
# Now the Abaqus model has just one door, so only one line is
# needed in the connectivity file.

# The connectivity file should usually be given. Without a
# Abaqus nset list, the FDS data is mapped to all Abaqus
# nsets and this is usually not wanted.

# FDS patches:
#   1: x=-5.0 door, ior=+1 face (fasing inside the car)
#   2: x=+5.0 door, ior=-1 face (fasing inside the car)
#   3: y=-1.5 door, ior=+2 face (fasing inside the car) This is now used
