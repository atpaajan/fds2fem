EU-Fire-Resist project, fds2fem mapping tool between FDS and ABAQUS
A metal-insulator chess board, 100 kw/m2 burner, size 0.2 m x 0.2 m
centrally located.

This FDS file produces outputs both for wall (surface) temperature and
adiabatic surface temperature. Both BNDF and DEVC outputs are produced.
This means that just one FDS calculation is needed for all different
fds2fem options (transfered quantity, bndf/devc data).
